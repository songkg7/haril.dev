Obsidian's Wiki links are converted to plain text.

### Before

```md

```

### After

```md
What is Obsidian?
```

## Image

:::warning

Image conversion is not supported yet.

:::tip

Using the [imgur plugin](https://github.com/gavvvr/obsidian-imgur-plugin) means you don't need to manage images as files.

:::

## Embeds

Obsidian's Embeds are converted to plain text.

### Before

```md
![[Obsidian#This is Obsidian]]
```

### After

```md
Obsidian
```

Currently, only the Obsidian simple footnote method is supported.
