Have you ever felt overwhelmed at the thought of setting up your development environment again after getting a new MacBook? Or perhaps you found a fantastic tool during work, but felt too lazy to set it up again in your personal environment at home? Have you ever hesitated to push your configurations to GitHub due to security concerns?

If you've ever used multiple devices, you might have faced these dilemmas. How can you manage your configurations consistently across different platforms?

## Problem

Configuration files like `.zshrc` for various software are scattered across different paths, including $HOME (root). However, setting up Git at the root for version control of these files can be daunting. The wide range of scanning involved can actually make managing the files more difficult.

Maintaining a consistent development environment across three devices â€“ a MacBook for work, an iMac at home, and a personal MacBook â€“ seemed practically impossible.

> Modifying just one Vim shortcut at work and realizing you have to do the same on the other two devices after work... ðŸ˜­

With the advent of the Apple Silicon era, the significant disparity between Intel Macs and the new devices made achieving a unified environment even more challenging. I had pondered over this issue for quite some time, as I often forgot to set up aliases frequently used at work on my home machine.

Some of the methods I tried to solve this problem briefly were:

1. **Centralizing dotfiles in a specific folder and managing them as a Git project**
    1. The locations of dotfiles vary. In most cases, there are predefined locations even if they are not in the root.
    2. You cannot work directly in a folder with Git set up, and you still have to resort to copy-pasting on other devices.

2. **Symbolic link**
    1. To set up on a new device, you need to recreate symbolic links for all files in the correct locations(...). If you have many files to manage, this can be a tiresome task.
    2. The usage is more complex than Git, requiring attention to various details.

In the end, I resorted to using the Git method but only for files not in the root (`~/.ssh/config`, `~/.config/nvim`, etc.), partially giving up on files using the root as the location (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.gitconfig`, etc.) until I discovered **chezmoi**!

Now, let me introduce you to **chezmoi**, which elegantly solves this challenging problem.

## What is Chezmoi?

> Manage your dotfiles across multiple diverse machines, securely.
> \- chezmoi.io

**Chezmoi** is a tool that allows you to manage numerous dotfiles consistently across various environments and devices. As described in the official documentation, with just a few settings, you can ensure 'security'. You don't need to worry about where your dotfiles are or where they should be. You simply need to inform **chezmoi** of the dotfiles to manage.

### Concept

How is this seemingly magical feat possible? ðŸ¤”

In essence, **chezmoi** stores dotfiles in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` and when you run `chezmoi apply`, it checks the status of each dotfile, making minimal changes to ensure they match the desired state. For more detailed concepts, refer to the [reference manual](https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/concepts/).

Let's now briefly explain how to use it.

## Getting Started with Chezmoi

Once you have installed **chezmoi** (installation guide [here](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/)), perform the initialization with the following command:

```bash
chezmoi init
```

This action creates a new Git repository in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` (working directory) on your local device to store dotfiles. By default, **chezmoi** reflects modifications in the working directory on your local device.

If you want to manage your `~/.zshrc` file through **chezmoi**, run the following command:

```bash
chezmoi add ~/.zshrc
```

You will see that the `~/.zshrc` file has been copied to `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_zshrc`.

To edit the `~/.zshrc` file managed by **chezmoi**, use the following command:

```bash
chezmoi edit ~/.zshrc
```

This command opens `~/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_zshrc` with `$EDITOR` for editing. Make some changes for testing and save.

:::info

If `$EDITOR` is not in the environment variables, it defaults to using `vi`.

:::

To check what changes have been made in the working directory, use the following command:

```bash
chezmoi diff
```

If you want to apply the changes made by **chezmoi** to your local device, use the following command:

```bash
chezmoi apply -v
```

All **chezmoi** commands can use the `-v` (verbose) option. This option visually displays what is being applied to your local device, making it clear in the console. By using the `-n` (dry run) option, you can execute commands without applying them. Therefore, combining the `-v` and `-n` options allows you to preview what actions will be taken when running unfamiliar commands.

Now, let's access the source directory directly and push the contents of **chezmoi** to a remote repository. It is recommended to name the repository `dotfiles`, as I will explain later.

```bash
chezmoi cd
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
git push
```

:::tip

By writing the relevant settings in the `chezmoi.toml` file, you can automate the repository synchronization process for more convenient use.

:::

To exit the **chezmoi** working directory, use the following command:

```bash
exit
```

Visualizing the process up to this point, it looks like this:

## Using Chezmoi on Another Device

This is why we use **chezmoi**. Let's fetch the contents on the second device using **chezmoi**. I have used an SSH URL for this example. Assume that **chezmoi** is already installed on the second device.

```bash
chezmoi init git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
```

By initializing with a specific repository, **chezmoi** automatically checks for submodules or necessary external source files and generates the chezmoi config file based on the options.

Inspect what changes **chezmoi** will bring to the second device using the `diff` command we saw earlier.

```bash
chezmoi diff
```

If you are satisfied with applying all the changes, use the `apply` command we discussed earlier.

```bash
chezmoi apply -v
```

If you need to modify some files before applying locally, use `edit`.

```bash
chezmoi edit $FILE
```

Alternatively, you can use a merge tool to apply local changes as if you were using Git merge.

```bash
chezmoi merge $FILE
```

:::tip

Using `chezmoi merge-all` will perform a merge operation on all files that require merging.

:::

You can perform all these steps at once with the following command:

```bash
chezmoi update -v
```

Visualizing this process, it looks like this:

![image](./using-chezmoi-second-machine.webp)

You can also apply all the steps needed on the second device at initialization...! This feature can be incredibly useful if the second device is a newly purchased one.

```bash
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
```

I recommended naming the repository `dotfiles` earlier because if the repository is named `dotfiles`, you can use a shortened version of the previous command.

```bash
chezmoi init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

![image](./shorten-init.webp)

It's truly convenient...ðŸ¥¹ I believe it will be one of the best open-source tools discovered in 2023.

## Conclusion

**Chezmoi** is impressively well-documented and actively developed. Developed in Golang, it feels quite fast ðŸ˜„. With some knowledge of shell scripting, you can implement highly automated processes, creating an environment where you hardly need to intervene for settings across multiple devices.

In this article, I covered the basic usage of **chezmoi**. In the next article, we will delve into managing **chezmoi** configuration files and maintaining security.
