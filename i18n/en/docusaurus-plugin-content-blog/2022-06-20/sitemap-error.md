I had registered the `sitemap.xml` for my blog to ensure it gets indexed by Google, but all I was getting was an error message saying 'sitemap not found'. Finally, I managed to resolve it, and I am sharing the method I used.

While this method may not solve every case, it seems worth a try.

Simply run the following command:

```bash
curl https://www.google.com/ping\?sitemap\={path to your submitted sitemap}
```

And then, when you check the search console again...!

![sitemap-success](./sitemap-success.webp)
_Finally resolved after almost a month...😢_

The sitemap is finally being recognized.

Hope this helps!
