## Overview

Recently, as I started using Vim, I've been aligning all my environments with Vim. Among them, I noticed that there are some differences in the shortcuts between Vimari, the Vim extension for Safari, and Vimium, the extension for Chrome. To unify them, I decided to remap specific keys. In this guide, I will introduce how to remap shortcuts in Vimium.

## Vimium Options Window

![where](./1.webp)

Click the button in the Chrome extension to open the options.

![input](./2.webp)

By modifying this section, you can change the shortcuts. The basic mapping method is the same as in Vim. Personally, I found it more convenient to change the tab navigation shortcuts from q, w in Vimari to J, K in Vimium.

If you're unsure which key to map to a specific action, you can click on "show available commands" next to it for a helpful explanation.

![help-view](./3.webp)

From here, you can find the desired action and map it to a specific key.
